###Verifying for a school liscence
To get things started, you first need to open up any internet browser to get to the MATLAB home page. Since you are a Waterloo student
you do not have to actually purchase a MATLAB liscence since the school already has one. Click "Check for access" shown below:


Enter in the name of your school, school email along with other information shown on the page below.


Afterwards you should prompted to the following screen, along with an email in your outlook congratulating your approval.

###Creating a Mathworks account 
To actually use MATLAB you first need to create a Mathworks account. Click the link provided in your **email** and "press create account"
located near the bottom of the page:

>Enter in the necessary information that applies to you.

After creating your account, go back to your email and copy and paste the link provided to you. Press the "Sign in to get started" button.

>Do not worry about linking your Mathworks account and your account license yet.

Press "Download Installer" and select the most recent version of MATLAB by pressing the big blue "R2020a" button.

>Please select your computer opertor that you currently have.

Afterwards, sit tight and watch your installer being downloaded!

Select the installer from the bottom of your browser and wait for MATLAB files to be extracted. After the installation is finished, allow 
MATLAB to make changes to your computer.

>If you have a firewall protecting some files being extracted like in my case, press "allow access".

We're almost there, Enter your Mathworks info and accept terms and conditions.

Select the MATLAB Liscence that is on **your** screen and confirm your selection.

>You may pick a specific file destination after this point, however I would just leave the file destination that is already suggested.

For license selection, pick MATLAB and Simulink as shown below and hit next.

Select the options that best suit you and head straight to the confirmation page to finish your installation. Press "Begin install"
